# mycd

mycd.cpp is a string-based unix "cd" command simulator written in c++. It is 
compiled to the executable mycd and tested by mycdtester.py, which checks 
functionality according to testcases.txt and saves results in testresults.txt

This was run on my device with Python 3.8.10 on Ubuntu distribution 20.04.3 and
the executable was compiled with g++ version 9.4.0
